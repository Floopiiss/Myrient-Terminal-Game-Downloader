## ‚ùóReminder‚ùó

- No Piracy, Piracy is really bad and we don't want to do anything super bad
- This tool scrapes and downloads files from [myrient.erista.me](https://myrient.erista.me)
- I Developed this to make Downloading quicker and easier, but if this program goes against website TOS, just send me a message and ill take it down.
- It says "This means not limiting users from being able to play their favorite video game or simply having an archive for themselves", which i took as free reign to develop this tool.

## Features

- Scrapes the latest game list automatically üîç  
- Search games by name (case-insensitive, but the search is kind of terrible, just enter one word from the title and search through the list)  
- Interactive selection of matching games  
- Downloads with progress bar ‚è≥  
- Handles download interruptions gracefully ‚ùå  
- Downloads the ZIP Content to the same Directory
- Good Enough Validation ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø , don't purposefully break it
- Features Nintendo, Sony, and Xbox Games

## Shortcomings/Issues

- If you search for Europe or USA or something, then it may only display some of the results

-  There is probably something that can crash, i couldnt be arsed to check all of it tho.
-  Eventually (someday), i will add a sort to only check depending on the Region you select
-  I also want to add a GUI, but that looks annoying so dont expect it anytime soon
